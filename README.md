The Makers Academy Marketing Array (MAMA) have asked us to provide a game for them. Their daily grind is pretty tough and they need time to steam off a little.

The task is to provide a Rock, Paper, Scissors game for them so they can play on the web with the following features: 

- the marketeer has to enter their name before the game
- the marketeer will be presented the choices(rock, paper, scissors)
- the marketeer can choose a random option
- a winner will be declared

Bonus 1:

Change the game so that two marketeers can play against each other (yes there are two of them).

Bonus 2: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Spock, Lizard

Special rules found here: www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock
